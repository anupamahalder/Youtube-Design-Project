            <div class="px-10">
                <p>In JavaScript, <span class="font-bold">var</span>, <span class="font-bold">let</span>, and <span class="font-bold">const</span> are used to declare variables, but they have different scopes and behaviors. Understanding the scope of these variables is crucial for writing reliable and maintainable code.</p>

                <h1 class="font-bold text-2xl">1. var:</h1>
                <div class="pl-8 py-4"><li><span class="text-xl font-bold">Function Scope:</span> Variables declared with `var` are function-scoped. This means they are only accessible within the function in which they are declared.</li>
                <br><li><span class="text-xl font-bold">Hoisting:</span> Variables declared with <strong>var</strong> are hoisted to the top of their containing function or global scope. This means you can access them before they are declared in the code, but they will be undefined until they are assigned a value.</li>
                <br><li><span class="text-xl font-bold">Reassignment and Redefinition:</span> You can reassign and redefine variables declared with <strong>var</strong> within their scope.</li>
                </div>

                <h1 class="font-bold text-2xl">2. let:</h1>
                <div class="pl-8 py-4">
                    <li><span class="text-xl font-bold">Block Scope:</span> Variables declared with `let` are block-scoped, meaning they are limited to the nearest enclosing curly braces (`{}`), whether it's a function, loop, or any block of code.</li>
                <br>
                <li><span class="text-xl font-bold">Hoisting:</span> Like <strong>var</strong>, <strong>let</strong> is also hoisted, but it is not initialized until its declaration is reached in the code. Accessing it before the declaration will result in a <strong>ReferenceError</strong>.</li>

                <br><li><span class="text-xl font-bold">Reassignment:</span> You can reassign variables declared with `let` within the same block, but not redefine them in the same scope.</li>
                </div>

                <h1 class="font-bold text-2xl">3. const:</h1>
                <div class="pl-8 py-4"><li><span class="text-xl font-bold">Block Scope:</span> Like <strong>let</strong>, variables declared with <strong>const</strong> are block-scoped.</li><br>
                <li><span class="text-xl font-bold">Hoisting:</span> <strong>const</strong> is also hoisted, but like <strong>let</strong>, it's not initialized until its declaration is reached in the code.</li><br>
                <li><span class="text-xl font-bold">Immutability:</span> Variables declared with <strong>const</strong> are constant, meaning their value cannot be reassigned after initialization. However, for objects and arrays declared with <strong>const</strong>, their properties or elements can still be modified.</li><br>

                <li><span class="text-xl font-bold">Redefinition:</span> Just like <strong>let</strong>, you cannot redefine variables declared with <strong>const</strong> in the same scope.</li>

            <li class="text-3xl text-red-800 py-7 px-6 font-bold">Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</li>
            <div class="px-10">
                <strong>null</strong> and <strong>undefined</strong> are two special values in JavaScript that represent the absence of a value or the lack of a meaningful value. They have specific use cases, and understanding when to use each is essential for writing clean and error-free code.

                <h1 class="font-bold text-2xl">1. undefined:</h1>
                <div class="pl-8 py-4">
                <li><span class="text-xl font-bold">Default Value:</span> When a variable is declared but not initialized, it has an <strong>undefined</strong> value by default.</li><br>

                <li><span class="text-xl font-bold">Function Parameters:</span> If a function is called with fewer arguments than declared parameters, the missing parameters are <strong>undefined</strong>.</li><br>

                <li><span class="text-xl font-bold">Object Properties:</span> When you try to access an object property that doesn't exist, it returns <strong>undefined</strong>.</li>
                </div>

                <h1 class="font-bold text-2xl">2. null:</h1>
                <div class="pl-8 py-4">
                <li><span class="text-xl font-bold">Intentional Absence:</span> <strong>null</strong> is typically used when you want to explicitly indicate that a variable or object property should have no value or represent the absence of a meaningful value.</li><br>


                <li><span class="text-xl font-bold">Clearing Object Properties:</span> You can set an object property to <strong>null</strong> to indicate that it has no value or should be cleared.</li><br>


                <li><span class="text-xl font-bold">As a Placeholder:</span> Sometimes, developers use <strong>null</strong> as a placeholder when they know a value will be assigned later.</li>

            <li class="text-3xl text-red-800 py-7 px-6 font-bold">What do you mean by REST API?</li>
            <div class="px-10 mb-10">
                REST API, or Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface, is an architectural style and a set of constraints for designing networked applications. It is a widely used approach for building web services that are scalable, stateless, and easy to maintain. REST APIs are commonly used in web development for client-server communication over HTTP. <br> <br>

                Key characteristics and principles of RESTful APIs include: <br><br>
                <div class="pl-3">
                    <span class="text-xl font-bold">1. Statelessness:</span> Each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. The server should not rely on any previous client requests or store client state on the server between requests. This property makes REST APIs highly scalable.<br><br>

                    <span class="text-xl font-bold">2. Resources:</span> In a REST API, resources are the key abstractions. Resources can represent objects, data, or services, and they are identified by unique URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers). Resources can have multiple representations (e.g., JSON, XML) to support various client requirements.<br><br>

                    <span class="text-xl font-bold">3. HTTP Verbs:</span> RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods (verbs) to perform actions on resources. The most common HTTP methods used in REST are: <br>
                        <div class="pl-4">
                            - <strong>GET</strong>: Retrieve data from the server. <br>
                            - <strong>POST</strong>: Create a new resource on the server. <br>
                            - <strong>PUT</strong>: Update an existing resource on the server. <br>
                            - <strong>DELETE</strong>: Remove a resource from the server. <br>
                        </div>
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="text-xl font-bold">4. CRUD Operations:</span> REST APIs often map CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to HTTP methods. For example: <br>
                        <div class="pl-4">
                            - <strong>GET</strong> is used for reading (retrieving) resources. <br>
                            - <strong>POST</strong> is used for creating resources. <br>
                            - <strong>PUT</strong> is used for updating resources. <br>
                            - <strong>DELETE</strong> is used for deleting resources. <br>
                        </div>
                    <br><br>

                    <span class="text-xl font-bold">5. Uniform Interface:</span> REST APIs have a uniform and consistent interface, which means that they follow a set of conventions and patterns for interacting with resources. This simplifies both client and server implementations.<br><br>

                    <span class="text-xl font-bold">6. Stateless Communication:</span> Each client request to the server is treated as an independent and complete request. The server does not maintain any client-specific state between requests, which makes it easier to scale and maintain the server.<br><br>

                    <span class="text-xl font-bold">7. Representation:</span> Resources can have different representations, such as JSON, XML, or HTML, depending on the client's needs. Clients specify the desired representation through content negotiation, typically by setting the `Accept` header in the HTTP request.<br><br>

                    <span class="text-xl font-bold">8. Layered System:</span> REST architectures can be composed of multiple layers, where each layer has a specific responsibility. This separation of concerns allows for improved scalability and flexibility.<br><br>

                    <span class="text-xl font-bold">9. Client-Server Separation:</span> The client and server are separate entities, and each has its own set of responsibilities. This separation allows for more flexibility and independence in development.<br><br>

                    <span class="text-xl font-bold">10. Stateless Communication:</span> Each client request to the server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. The server does not maintain any client-specific state between requests. <br>
                </div>
                RESTful APIs are widely used for building web services because of their simplicity, scalability, and compatibility with the HTTP protocol, making them suitable for a wide range of applications, including web and mobile applications, IoT devices, and more.
